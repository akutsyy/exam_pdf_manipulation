# Exam Pdf Manipulation scripts
Terrible python scripts to aid in submitting 2020 Cambridge CS exams

-splitter.py splits a pdf into individual questions, and can ommit pages (yes the input format is bizzare)

-cover.py automatically out the exam number, question number, and completed questions on the cover sheet and attaches it to the relevant question

IMPORTANT: cover.py expects that the BGN and all relevant checkboxes are filled out, and that ALL questions you are submitting are in a single directory with the format p[paper num]q[question num].pdf

The scripts worked for me but you really should look over everything before submitting.
